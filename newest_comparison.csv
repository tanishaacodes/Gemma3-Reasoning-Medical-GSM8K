Do ART patients face higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery?,Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: The mode of delivery depends on multiple parameters. After assisted reproductive technology (ART), previous studies have shown elevated C-section rates but few studies differentiated between elective and emergency operations and different protocols of cryopreservation. Because these studies did not use multiparity as exclusion criteria which reduces confounding with previous pregnancies, aim of this study is to compare mode of delivery of different techniques of ART using data of primiparae only [1, 2]. Retrospective analysis of patient data treated at the university hospital of Luebeck in a period of 12 years. Patients were divided in different groups according to their way of conception: spontaneous conception and conception after ART. The group of ART was further divided into: (a) a group of fresh transferred embryos (IVF/ICSI), (b) vitrification and (c) slow freezing. Exclusion criteria were defined as: multiparity, delivery<24. + 0 p.m., incomplete data and treatment outside university of Luebeck. Main parameter of this study was mode of delivery which was divided into spontaneous delivery or C-section. C-sections were further differentiated into elective or emergency C-sections. The group of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing showed higher risks for elective and emergency C-sections (elective C-sections odds ratio 2.0, CI 95% 1.6-2.6, emergency C-sections odds ratio 1.4, CI 95% 1.1-1.9). Moreover, all groups of ART show enhanced risk of significant perinatal bleeding.

Question: Do ART patients face higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery?
model
<thought> The study focuses on comparing C-section rates between different ART techniques – IVF/ICSI, vitrification, and slow freezing – in a specific period and across different types of conception. It doesn’t directly address whether ART patients face higher C-section rates overall, but rather compares the C-section rates *within* those specific methods.

<answer>
Yes, the study indicates that ART patients, particularly those undergoing elective C-sections, face higher C-section rates compared to those undergoing emergency C-sections. Specifically, the odds ratio for elective C-sections is 2.0, with a 95% CI of 1.6-2.6, while the odds ratio for emergency C-sections is 1.4, with a 95% CI of 1.1-1.9."
Does a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improve bariatric surgery outcomes?,MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Many insurance payors mandate that bariatric surgery candidates undergo a medically supervised weight management (MSWM) program as a prerequisite for surgery. However, there is little evidence to support this requirement. We evaluated in a randomized controlled trial the hypothesis that participation in a MSWM program does not predict outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population. This pilot randomized trial was conducted in a large academic urban public hospital. Patients who met NIH consensus criteria for bariatric surgery and whose insurance did not require a mandatory 6-month MSWM program were randomized to a MSWM program with monthly visits over 6 months (individual or group) or usual care for 6 months and then followed for bariatric surgery outcomes postoperatively. Demographics, weight, and patient behavior scores, including patient adherence, eating behavior, patient activation, and physical activity, were collected at baseline and at 6 months (immediately preoperatively and postoperatively). A total of 55 patients were enrolled in the study with complete follow-up on 23 patients. Participants randomized to a MSWM program attended an average of 2 sessions preoperatively. The majority of participants were female and non-Caucasian, mean age was 46 years, average income was less than $20,000/year, and most had Medicaid as their primary insurer, consistent with the demographics of the hospital's bariatric surgery program. Data analysis included both intention-to-treat and completers' analyses. No significant differences in weight loss and most patient behaviors were found between the two groups postoperatively, suggesting that participation in a MSWM program did not improve weight loss outcomes for LAGB. Participation in a MSWM program did appear to have a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively.

Question: Does a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improve bariatric surgery outcomes?
model
<thought> The study found no significant difference in weight loss outcomes between patients who participated in a preoperative MSWM program and those who received usual care postoperatively. However, participation in the MSWM program did appear to have a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively."
Is solitary kidney really more resistant to ischemia?,"Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To our knowledge there are no evidence-based medicine data to date to critically judge the vulnerability of a solitary kidney to warm ischemia compared to paired kidneys. Ten dogs were exposed to open right nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In group 1 clearance decreased by 20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration starting at 1 week. In group 2 there was more pronounced tubular necrosis (90%) with regeneration starting at 2 weeks. The expression of proinflammatory markers was up-regulated in each group with higher, more sustained expression in group 2.

Question: Is solitary kidney really more resistant to ischemia?
model
<answer> The text does not explicitly state whether solitary kidney is *more* resistant to ischemia. It only describes the observed differences in clearance and recovery rates between the two groups. However, it does suggest that group 2 (dogs with both kidneys) exhibited a greater reduction in clearance compared to group 1 (solitary kidney). Therefore, it’s plausible that solitary kidneys might be more resistant, but further research is needed to confirm this definitively."
Neck pain treatment with acupuncture: does the number of needles matter?,"For this pathology, the number of needles, 5 or 11, seems not to be an important variable in determining the therapeutic effect when the time of stimulation is the same in the two groups.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Acupuncture has been successfully used in myofascial pain syndromes. However, the number of needles used, that is, the dose of acupuncture stimulation, to obtain the best antinociceptive efficacy is still a matter of debate. The question was addressed comparing the clinical efficacy of two different therapeutic schemes, characterized by a different number of needles used on 36 patients between 29-60 years of age with by a painful cervical myofascial syndrome. Patients were divided into two groups; the first group of 18 patients were treated with 5 needles and the second group of 18 patients were treated with 11 needles, the time of needle stimulation was the same in both groups: 100 seconds. Each group underwent six cycles of somatic acupuncture. Pain intensity was evaluated before, immediately after and 1 and 3 months after the treatment by means of both the Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In both groups, the needles were fixed superficially excluding the two most painful trigger points where they were deeply inserted. Both groups, independently from the number of needles used, obtained a good therapeutic effect without clinically relevant differences.

Question: Neck pain treatment with acupuncture: does the number of needles matter?
model
<answer>No, the number of needles used does not appear to matter significantly in this study. The results show that both groups (5 needles and 11 needles) achieved a good therapeutic effect without clinically relevant differences in pain intensity measured after 1 and 3 months."
Does fluoridation reduce the use of dental services among adults?,"Among adults aged 20 to 34 years with private dental insurance, fluoridation reduces oral disease but may or may not reduce use of restorative services, depending on dentists' clinical decisions.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: The authors determine whether prevention influences the use of health services. Fluoridation's effect on restorative dental demand among 972 Washington state employees and spouses, aged 20 to 34 years, in two fluoridated communities and a nonfluoridated community was examined. At baseline, adults were interviewed by telephone, and oral assessments were conducted to measure personal characteristics, lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, oral disease, and the quality of restorations. Adults were followed for 2 years to measure dental demand from dental claims. Each adult's baseline and claims data were linked with provider and practice variables collected from the dentist who provided treatment. Relative to adults with no lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, adults drinking fluoridated water for half or more of their lives had less disease at baseline and a lower but nonsignificant probability of receiving a restoration in the follow-up period. In the 2-year follow-up period, however, more than half of the restorations were performed to replace fillings of satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline. When only teeth with decay and unsatisfactory fillings at baseline were considered, adults with high fluoridation exposure had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than adults with no exposure. Market effects also were detected in demand equations; relative to adults in the nonfluoridated community, adults residing in the fluoridated community with a large dentist supply received a greater number of restorations, suggesting potential supplier-induced demand from less disease and fewer patients.

Pertrochanteric fractures: is there an advantage to an intramedullary nail?,"There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To compare the results between a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. Prospective computer-generated randomization of 206 patients into two study groups: those treated by sliding compression hip screw (Group 1; n = 106) and those treated by intramedullary nailing (Group 2; n = 100). University Level I trauma center. All patients over the age of fifty-five years presenting with fractures of the trochanteric region caused by a low-energy injury, classified as AO/OTA Type 31-A1 and A2. Treatment with a sliding compression hip screw (Dynamic Hip Screw; Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or an intramedullary nail (Proximal Femoral Nail; Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Intraoperative: operative and fluoroscopy times, the difficulty of the operation, intraoperative complications, and blood loss. Radiologic: fracture healing and failure of fixation. Clinical: pain, social functioning score, and mobility score. The minimum follow-up was one year. We did not find any statistically significant difference, intraoperatively, radiologically, or clinically, between the two groups of patients.

<answer>No. The context states that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients, intraoperatively, radiologically, or clinically."
SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?,"Our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals. Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later.

Question: SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?
model
Yes, the text suggests a correlation between SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) and Parkinson’s disease.

Here’s a breakdown of how the text implies this:

*   **“SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor”**: This is the core of the study’s focus.
*   **“reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients”**: This is a key finding – the study demonstrates that patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) tend to have a *reduced* uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the putamen compared to patients with essential tremor.
*   **“There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV”**: This further reinforces the correlation – patients with right hemi-parkinsonism (a specific subtype of PD) show a *reduced* uptake in the left putamen compared to the SPECT study.

Therefore, the text explicitly states that the reduced uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the putamen is observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease,"
Are the GFRUP's recommendations for withholding or withdrawing treatments in critically ill children applicable?,"GFRUPs procedure was applicable in most cases. The main difficulties were anticipating the correct date for the meeting and involving nurses in the procedure. Children for whom the procedure was interrupted because of clinical improvement and who survived in poor condition without a formal decision pointed out the need for medical criteria for questioning, which should systematically lead to a formal decision-making process.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To evaluate feasibility of the guidelines of the Groupe Francophone de Réanimation et Urgence Pédiatriques (French-speaking group of paediatric intensive and emergency care; GFRUP) for limitation of treatments in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). A 2-year prospective survey. A 12-bed PICU at the Hôpital Jeanne de Flandre, Lille, France. Were included when limitation of treatments was expected. Of 967 children admitted, 55 were included with a 2-day median delay. They were younger than others (24 v 60 months), had a higher paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score (14 v 4), and a higher paediatric overall performance category (POPC) score at admission (2 v 1); all p<0.002. 34 (50% of total deaths) children died. A limitation decision was made without meeting for 7 children who died: 6 received do-not-resuscitate orders (DNROs) and 1 received withholding decision. Decision-making meetings were organised for 31 children, and the following decisions were made: 12 DNROs (6 deaths and 6 survivals), 4 withholding (1 death and 3 survivals), with 14 withdrawing (14 deaths) and 1 continuing treatment (survival). After limitation, 21 (31% of total deaths) children died and 10 survived (POPC score 4). 13 procedures were interrupted because of death and 11 because of clinical improvement (POPC score 4). Parents' opinions were obtained after 4 family conferences (for a total of 110 min), 3 days after inclusion. The first meeting was planned for 6 days after inclusion and held on the 7th day after inclusion; 80% of parents were immediately informed of the decision, which was implemented after half a day.

Question: Are the GFRUP's recommendations for withholding or withdrawing treatments in critically ill children applicable?
model
<thought> The text doesn’t explicitly state whether the GFRUP’s recommendations are applicable. However, it does state that children who died due to limitation decisions were either given DNROs or withholding orders. This suggests a potential application of both strategies. It’s a nuanced situation requiring further analysis.

<answer>
The text doesn’t definitively state whether the GFRUP’s recommendations are *automatically* applicable. It describes specific actions taken during limitation decisions – namely, the issuance of DNROs or withholding orders – but doesn’t explicitly state whether these are required or preferred. The fact that 34 children died due to limitation decisions, and 13 interrupted procedures, indicates a potential application of both withholding and DNROs. However, the specific guidelines of the GFRUP need to be examined in conjunction with the specific circumstances of the children’s cases."
Is inhaled prophylactic heparin useful for prevention and Management of Pneumonia in ventilated ICU patients?,Nebulized heparin cannot be recommended for prophylaxis against VAP or to hasten recovery from pneumonia in patients receiving MV.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To determine whether prophylactic inhaled heparin is effective for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit. A phase 2, double blind randomized controlled trial stratified for study center and patient type (non-operative, post-operative) was conducted in three university-affiliated intensive care units. Patients aged ≥18years and requiring invasive MV for more than 48hours were randomized to usual care, nebulization of unfractionated sodium heparin (5000 units in 2mL) or placebo nebulization with 0.9% sodium chloride (2mL) four times daily with the main outcome measures of the development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator associated complication (VAC) and sequential organ failure assessment scores in patients with pneumonia on admission or who developed VAP. Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612000038897. Two hundred and fourteen patients were enrolled (72 usual care, 71 inhaled sodium heparin, 71 inhaled sodium chloride). There were no differences between treatment groups in terms of the development of VAP, using either Klompas criteria (6-7%, P=1.00) or clinical diagnosis (24-26%, P=0.85). There was no difference in the clinical consistency (P=0.70), number (P=0.28) or the total volume of secretions per day (P=.54). The presence of blood in secretions was significantly less in the usual care group (P=0.005).

Is the h-index predictive of greater NIH funding success among academic radiologists?,"Having obtained at least one NIH grant was associated with a higher h-index, yet multiple or large grants, such as those for program projects, were not predictive of higher h-indices.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Despite rapid adoption of the Hirsch index (h-index) as a measure of academic success, the correlations between the h-index and other metrics of productivity remain poorly understood. The aims of this study were to determine whether h-indices were associated with greater National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding success among academic radiologists. Using the Scopus database, h-indices were calculated for a random sample of academic radiologists with the rank of professor. Using the NIH tool Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports, we determined the number, classification, and total years of NIH grant funding as principal investigator for each radiologist. Differences in h-index, sorted by funding status, were determined using Wilcoxon's tests. Associations between h-index and funding status were determined using logistic regression. Significant correlations between h-index and grant metrics were determined using Spearman's ρ. Among 210 professors of radiology, 48 (23%) secured at least one NIH grant. The mean h-index was significantly higher among individuals who secured at least one NIH grant (19.1) compared to those who did not (10.4) (P<.0001). Professors with h-indices<10 compared to those with h-indices>10 were significantly less likely to receive NIH funding (odds ratio, 0.07; P = .0321). However, h-indices>10 were not significantly predictive of greater funding. No significant relationships were observed between h-index and the number of grant awards, years of prior funding, the amounts of grant awards, or grant classification.

Question: Is the h-index predictive of greater NIH funding success among academic radiologists?
model
<answer>
No, according to the study, the h-index was not found to be predictive of greater NIH funding success."
Is minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords reproducible and applicable in routine surgery?,"Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Traditional resectional techniques and chordal transfer are difficult to apply in video-assisted mitral valve repair. Using artificial chords appears easier in this setting. The purpose of this study was to review the effectiveness and reproducibility of neochordal repair as a routine approach to minimally invasive mitral repair, and to assess the stability of neochord implantation using the figure-of-eight suture without pledgets in this setting. This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent minimally invasive video-assisted mitral valve repair from 2008 to 2013. The primary endpoints were recurrent mitral regurgitation and reoperation. A total of 426 consecutive patients were included during the study period, with a mean age of 55 ± 18 years. Neochords were used in all patients, and in association with leaflet resection in 47 patients. One patient was not repairable and underwent valve replacement (repair rate, 99.8%). Fifteen patients had Grade I (3.5%) regurgitation, whereas the remainder had none. Patients were fast-tracked, with 25% extubated in the operation theatre and the remainder within 6 h. There were 5 deaths within 30 days (1.2%). Follow-up ranged 3-60 months, during which all of the patients remained with no or trace mitral regurgitation. No de-insertion or rupture of any neochords was found, and no patients required a reoperation.

"Does obesity predict knee pain over fourteen years in women, independently of radiographic changes?","Over 14 years, a higher BMI predicts knee pain at Y15 in women, independently of radiographic knee OA. When adjusted, the association was significant in bilateral, not unilateral, knee pain, suggesting alternative pathologic mechanisms may exist. The longitudinal effect of BMI on knee pain at Y15 is equally important at any time point, which may assist reducing the population burden of knee pain.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To examine longitudinal patterns in body mass index (BMI) over 14 years and its association with knee pain in the Chingford Study. We studied a total of 594 women with BMI data from clinic visits at years (Y) 1, 5, 10, and 15. Knee pain at Y15 was assessed by questionnaire. Associations between BMI over 14 years and knee pain at Y15 were examined using logistic regression. BMI significantly increased from Y1 to Y15 (P<0.0005) with medians (interquartile ranges) of 24.5 kg/m(2)  (22.5-27.2 kg/m(2) ) and 26.5 kg/m(2)  (23.9-30.1 kg/m(2) ), respectively. At Y15, 45.1% of subjects had knee pain. A greater BMI at Y1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]1.05-1.69), at Y15 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.61), and change in BMI over 15 years (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.93) were significant predictors of knee pain at Y15 (P<0.05). BMI change was associated with bilateral (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.05-1.76, P = 0.024) but not unilateral knee pain (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73-1.76, P = 0.298). The association between BMI change and knee pain was independent of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). The strength of association between BMI and knee pain at Y15 was similar during followup measurements.

Question: Does obesity predict knee pain over fourteen years in women, independently of radiographic changes?
model
<thought> The text states that the association between BMI change and knee pain was independent of radiographic changes, suggesting a potential independent predictive relationship. It also highlights that the strength of the association between BMI and knee pain at Y15 was similar during follow-up measurements.

<answer>
Yes, the text suggests that the association between BMI change and knee pain was independent of radiographic changes. This indicates that obesity, as measured by BMI change, may predict knee pain even without radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. The fact that the strength of the association was similar during follow-up measurements further supports this independent predictive relationship."
Do liquid-based preparations of urinary cytology perform differently than classically prepared cases?,"Liquid-based preparations performed significantly better in urinary cytology challenges when evaluating malignant categories in the College of American Pathologists interlaboratory comparison program. The liquid-based preparation challenges also performed better for the exact reference interpretation of HGUCA, but no difference was observed for adenocarcinoma challenges.

Context: The cytomorphology of liquid-based preparations in urine cytology is different than classic slide preparations. To compare the performance of liquid-based preparation specimens to classically prepared urine specimens with a malignant diagnosis in the College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Nongynecologic Cytology. Participant responses between 2000 and 2007 for urine specimens with a reference diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma/carcinoma in situ/dysplasia (HGUCA), squamous cell carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma were evaluated. ThinPrep and SurePath challenges were compared with classic preparations (smears, cytospins) for discordant responses. There were 18 288 pathologist, 11 957 cytotechnologist, and 8086 ""laboratory"" responses available. Classic preparations comprised 90% (n = 34 551) of urine challenges; 9% (n = 3295) were ThinPrep and 1% (n = 485) were SurePath. Concordance to the general category of ""positive-malignant"" was seen in 92% of classic preparations, 96.5% of ThinPrep, and 94.6% of SurePath challenges (P<.001). These results were statistically different for the exact reference interpretation of HGUCA (P<.001) but not for adenocarcinoma (P = .22). Cytotechnologists demonstrate statistically better performance for the general category of ""positive-malignant"" compared with pathologists for all urinary slide types and for the exact reference interpretation of HGUCA (94% versus 91.1%; P<.001) but not adenocarcinoma (96.3% versus 95.8%; P = .77) or squamous cell carcinoma (93.6% versus 87.7%; P = .07).

Question: Do liquid-based preparations of urinary cytology perform differently than classically prepared cases?

Outcomes of severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service: does trauma center level make a difference?,"Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there is an outcome benefit associated with the ""level of hospital"" initially treating severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts mortality and/or hospital length of stay. Outcomes were evaluated for severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)>15 using NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our regional health service. To assess the association between trauma centers and binary outcomes, a logistic regression model was used. To assess the association between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models. There were 1,986 trauma presentations during the 6-year period. Patients presenting to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death than those presenting to the level I center, regardless of age, sex, ISS, or prehospital time. Peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery in 15 cases associated with technical errors, delay in decision making, or errors of judgement.

Collateral flow index (CFI) was calculated as (Pw-Pv)/(Pa-Pv), where Pa, Pw, and Pv are aortic, coronary wedge, and right atrial pressures during maximum hyperaemia. Collateral supply was considered poor (CFI<0.25) or good (CFI>or = 0.25). In-stent restenosis six months after PCI, classified as neointimal volume>or = 25% stent volume on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), or minimum lumen area<or = 50% stent area on IVUS, or minimum lumen diameter<or = 50% reference vessel diameter on quantitative coronary angiography. Patients with good collaterals had more severe coronary stenoses at baseline (90 (11)% v 75 (16)%, p<0.001). Restenosis rates were similar in poor and good collateral groups (35% v 43%, p = 0.76 for diameter restenosis, 27% v 45%, p = 0.34 for area restenosis, and 23% v 24%, p = 0.84 for volumetric restenosis). CFI was not correlated with diameter, area, or volumetric restenosis (r2<0.1 for each). By multivariate analysis, stent diameter, stent length,>10% residual stenosis, and smoking history were predictive of restenosis.

Question: Does a well developed collateral circulation predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention?
model
<answer>Yes, the study suggests that a well-developed collateral circulation predisposes to restenosis after PCI. Patients with good collateral flow indices had a more severe coronary stenosis at baseline compared to those with poor collateral flow indices. Furthermore, stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history were all predictive of restenosis, indicating a complex relationship between collateral circulation and subsequent restenosis. Thinking about the context, the study highlights a potential risk factor – the presence of abundant collateral flow – that increases the likelihood of restenosis following PCI."
Are home sampling kits for sexually transmitted infections acceptable among men who have sex with men?,"The widespread acceptability of using HSKs for the diagnosis of STIs could have important public health impacts in terms of earlier diagnosis of asymptomatic infections and thus a decrease in the rate of onward transmission. In addition, HSKs could potentially optimize the use of genitourinary medicine services and facilitate patient choice.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: There is an urgent need to increase opportunistic screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in community settings, particularly for those who are at increased risk including men who have sex with men (MSM). The aim of this qualitative study was to explore whether home sampling kits (HSK) for multiple bacterial STIs are potentially acceptable among MSM and to identify any concerns regarding their use. This study was developed as part of a formative evaluation of HSKs. Focus groups and one-to-one semi-structured interviews with MSM were conducted. Focus group participants (n = 20) were shown a variety of self-sampling materials and asked to discuss them. Individual interviewees (n = 24) had experience of the self-sampling techniques as part of a pilot clinical study. All data were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach. The concept of a HSK was generally viewed as positive, with many benefits identified relating to increased access to testing, enhanced personal comfort and empowerment. Concerns about the accuracy of the test, delays in receiving the results, the possible lack of support and potential negative impact on 'others' were raised.

Does route of delivery affect maternal and perinatal outcome in women with eclampsia?,"A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying ≥34 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: The route of delivery in eclampsia is controversial. We hypothesized that adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes may not be improved by early cesarean delivery. This was a randomized controlled exploratory trial carried out in a rural teaching institution. In all, 200 eclampsia cases, carrying ≥34 weeks, were allocated to either cesarean or vaginal delivery. Composite maternal and perinatal event rates (death and severe morbidity) were compared by intention-to-treat principle. Groups were comparable at baseline with respect to age and key clinical parameters. Maternal event rate was similar: 10.89% in the cesarean arm vs 7.07% for vaginal delivery (relative risk, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-3.81). Although the neonatal event rate was less in cesarean delivery-9.90% vs 19.19% (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-1.05)-the difference was not significant statistically.

Question: Does route of delivery affect maternal and perinatal outcome in women with eclampsia?

Surgical management of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta: is endoaortic balloon occlusion safe?,"In this series, the endoaortic occlusion was frequently ineffective, and was associated with a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death and a numerically higher risk of stroke.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Occlusion of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta by an endoaortic inflatable balloon has been proposed as an alternative to conventional cross-clamping to prevent injury to the vessel and distal embolization of debris. The safety and the effectiveness of endoaortic occlusion have not been documented in this setting. Endoaortic occlusion was employed in 52 of 2,172 consecutive patients. Surgeon's choice was based on preoperative identification of aortic calcifications or intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning. Deaths and strokes were analyzed casewise and in aggregate. In 10 patients (19.2%), the endoaortic balloon had to be replaced by the ordinary cross-clamp because of incomplete occlusion (n = 5), hindered exposure (n = 2), or balloon rupture (n = 3). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other patients (4.2%, p<0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719). Although the stroke rate was higher in the endoaortic occlusion group compared with all other patients, the difference was only possibly significant (3.8% versus 0.8%, p = 0.067).

Question: Surgical management of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta: is endoaortic balloon occlusion safe?

<thought> The context discusses the safety of endoaortic balloon occlusion, but it doesn’t definitively state whether it’s safe. It highlights a significant higher death rate compared to other procedures and the expected estimate. It also notes that the stroke rate is higher in this group. However, it does not provide a conclusive answer about its safety. 

<answer> The context suggests the surgery is potentially risky due to a higher death rate and stroke risk compared to other procedures. Further research is needed to determine its true safety profile."
Estradiol and Antagonist Pretreatment Prior to Microdose Leuprolide in in Vitro Fertilization.

Context: To compare in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in low responders stimulated with microdose leuprolide protocol (ML) following pretreatment with either oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or luteal estradiol (E2) + GnRH antagonist (E2 + antag) for follicular synchronization prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). This was a retrospective study of 130 women, who were poor responders, undergoing IVF with either OCP/ML or E2+ antag/ML protocols. The main outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rates, number of oocytes retrieved, and cancellation rate. Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. There were no significant differences in gonadotropin requirement, cancellation rate, and number of embryos transferred. Ongoing pregnancy rates (40% vs. 15%) were significantly higher in the OCP/ML group. Trends toward greater number of oocytes retrieved (7.7 ± 3.4 vs. 5.9 ± 4.2) and improved implantation rates (20% vs. 12%) were also noted, but these did not reach statistical significance.

Are opioid dependence and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) documented in the medical record?,"Among patients receiving MMT and medical care at different sites, documentation of opioid dependence and MMT in the medical record occurs for the majority, but is missing in a substantial number of patients. Most of these patients are prescribed medications that potentially interact with methadone. This study highlights opportunities for improved coordination between medical care and MMT.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Opioid-dependent patients often have co-occurring chronic illnesses requiring medications that interact with methadone. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is typically provided separately from medical care. Hence, coordination of medical care and substance use treatment is important to preserve patient safety. To identify potential safety risks among MMT patients engaged in medical care by evaluating the frequency that opioid dependence and MMT documentation are missing in medical records and characterizing potential medication-methadone interactions. Among patients from a methadone clinic who received primary care from an affiliated, but separate, medical center, we reviewed electronic medical records for documentation of methadone, opioid dependence, and potential drug-methadone interactions. The proportions of medical records without opioid dependence and methadone documentation were estimated and potential medication-methadone interactions were identified. Among the study subjects (n = 84), opioid dependence documentation was missing from the medical record in 30% (95% CI, 20%-41%) and MMT documentation was missing from either the last primary care note or the last hospital discharge summary in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%). Sixty-nine percent of the study subjects had at least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone; 19% had 3 or more potentially interacting medications.

Context: (1) To describe the prevalence of general practitioner visits and hospitalization according to sex and age groups; (2) to identify which factors are independently associated with a higher use of health care services among elderly Spanish; and (3) to study the time trends in the prevalence of use of health care services 2001-2009. Observational study. We analyzed data from the Spanish National Health Surveys conducted in 2001 (n=21,058), 2003 (n=21,650), 2006 (n=29,478) and 2009 (n=22,188). We included responses from adults aged 65 years and older. The main variables were the number of general practitioner visits in the last 4 weeks and hospitalization in the past year. We stratified the adjusted models by the main variables. We analyzed socio-demographic characteristics, health related variables, using multivariate logistic regression models. The total number of subjects was 24,349 (15,041 woman, 9309 men). Women were significantly older than men (P<0.001). Women had higher prevalence of general practitioner visits than men in all surveys. Men had significantly higher prevalence of hospitalizations than women in the years 2001, 2006 and 2009. When we adjusted the hospitalization by possible confounders using logistic regressions, men had a higher probability of being hospitalized than women (OR 1.53, 1.39-1.69). The variables that were significantly associated with a higher use of health care services were lower educational level, worse self-rated health, chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and the level of disability. The number of general practitioner visits among women and men significantly increased from 2001 to 2009 (women: OR 1.43, 1.27-1.61; men: OR 1.71, 1.49-1.97).

Does high-dose radiotherapy benefit palliative lung cancer patients?,"The palliative treatment concept of 25 Gy applied in 5 fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: The present analysis compares two palliative treatment concepts for lung cancer in terms of overall survival. Survival data from 207 patients were used in a retrospective analysis. All patients received palliative treatment comprising either 25 Gy applied in 5 fractions or 50 Gy in 20 fractions. A subgroup analysis was performed to compare patients with a good-fair vs. poor overall condition. Median survival times were 21 weeks (range 6-26 weeks) for patients treated with 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 23 weeks (range 14.5-31.5 weeks) for patients treated with 50 Gy in 20 fractions (95 % confidence interval, CI; p = 0.334). For patients with a good-fair overall condition, median survival times were 30 weeks (21.8-39.2 weeks) for 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 28 weeks (14.2-41.8 weeks) for 50 Gy in 20 fractions (CI 95 %, p = 0.694). In patients with a poor overall condition, these values were 18 weeks (14.5-21.5 weeks) and 21 weeks (13.0-29.0 weeks), respectively (CI 95 %, p = 0.248).

Question: Does high-dose radiotherapy benefit palliative lung cancer patients?
model
<thought> The analysis suggests that patients receiving 25 Gy in 5 fractions have a higher median survival time compared to patients receiving 50 Gy in 20 fractions. Specifically, they have a median survival of 21 weeks versus 23 weeks. Furthermore, patients with a good-fair overall condition experience a longer survival time with 25 Gy in 5 fractions compared to 28 weeks with 50 Gy in 20 fractions. Therefore, high-dose radiotherapy appears to benefit palliative lung cancer patients."

Subclavian steal syndrome: can the blood pressure difference between arms predict the severity of steal?,"Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: A side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). It was the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS. The records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 3 Doppler waveform types. SSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 11 (22%) cases. Systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration group (P<.001).

Context: To assess whether eligibility to an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol in itself represents a good prognostic factor after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Between April 1984 and May 1989, our institution entered 35 patients with invasive bladder cancer into the Swiss Group for Clinical and Epidemiological Cancer Research (SAKK) study 09/84. They were randomly assigned to either observation or three postoperative courses of cisplatin monotherapy after cystectomy. This study had a negative result. The outcome of these 35 patients (protocol group) was compared with an age- and tumor-stage-matched cohort (matched group; n = 35) who also underwent cystectomy during the same period, but were not entered into the SAKK study, as well as the remaining 57 patients treated during the study period for the same indication (remaining group). Median overall survival decreased from 76.3 months in the protocol group to 52.1 months in the matched group and to 20.3 months in the remaining group. The respective times of median recurrence-free survival were 67.2, 16.0, and 9.4 months. Tumor progression occurred in 46% of the protocol group compared with 69% in the matched group and 65% in the remaining group (P<.05). Cancer-related death was noted in 40% of the protocol group, 57% in the matched group, and 56% in the remaining group.

Intravenous administration of metoclopramide by 2 min bolus vs 15 min infusion: does it affect the improvement of headache while reducing the side effects?,Slowing the infusion rate of metoclopramide is an effective strategy for the improvement of headache and reducing the incidence of akathisia in patients with vascular type headache.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To determine the therapeutic effect (alleviation of vascular type headache) and side effects of a slow intravenous metoclopramide infusion over 15 min compared with those effects of a bolus intravenous metoclopramide infusion over 2 min in the treatment of patients with recent onset vascular type headache. All adults treated with metoclopramide for vascular type headache were eligible for entry into this clinical randomised double blinded trial. This study compared the effects of two different rates of intravenous infusion of metoclopramide over a period of 13 months at a university hospital emergency department. During the trial, side effects and headache scores were recorded at baseline (0 min), and then at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the medication's efficacy and side effects. A total of 120 patients presenting to the emergency department met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 62 patients (51.7%) were given 10 mg metoclopramide as a slow intravenous infusion over 15 min (SIG group) and 58 patients (48.3%) were given 10 mg metoclopramide intravenous bolus infusion over 2 min (BIG group). 17 of the 58 patients in the BIG group (29.3%) and 4 of the 62 patients (6.5%) in the SIG group had akathisia (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences between the BIG and SIG groups in terms of mean headache scores (p = 0.34) and no adverse reactions in the study period. Metoclopramide successfully relieved the headache symptom(s) of patients in both the BIG and SIG groups.

Question: Intravenous administration of metoclopramide by 2 min bolus vs 15 min infusion: does it affect the improvement of headache while reducing the side effects?
model
<thought> The study compares the effectiveness and side effects of two different metoclopramide infusion rates in patients with recent onset vascular type headaches. The key question is whether the faster infusion rate (15 min) leads to better headache relief and fewer side effects compared to the slower rate (2 min).

<answer>
The study does not directly compare the effectiveness of the two infusion rates. It primarily focuses on comparing the *timing* of the infusion – whether it’s a quick bolus or a slower, continuous infusion.  However, the results suggest that both infusion rates effectively reduce headache symptoms in the patients studied.  The difference in side effects appears to be minimal, suggesting that the overall effect of the infusion is similar, regardless of the rate.  The study doesn’t explicitly state whether the faster infusion resulted in fewer side effects, but the fact that both groups experienced headache relief supports this observation.  Therefore, it’s difficult to definitively say whether the faster infusion *caused* the reduction in side effects, but it appears to be a beneficial outcome in itself."
Is the breast best for children with a family history of atopy?,Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Previous studies reported that breast-feeding protects children against a variety of diseases, but these studies were generally conducted on ""high-risk"" or hospitalized children. This paper describes the results of our study on the effects of breast-feeding on rate of illness in normal children with a family history of atopy. A historic cohort approach of 794 children with a family history of atopy was used to assess the effects of breast-feeding on illness rates. Family history of atopy was based on allergic diseases in family members as registered by the family physician. Illness data from birth onwards were available from the Continuous Morbidity Registration of the Department of Family Medicine. Information on breast-feeding was collected by postal questionnaire. We then compared rates of illness between children with a family history of atopy who were and who were not breast-fed. Breast-feeding was related to lower levels of childhood illness both in the first and the first three years of life. In the first year of life they had fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders. Over the next three years of life they had fewer respiratory tract infections and skin infections.

Question: Is the breast best for children with a family history of atopy?

<answer>No, the study does not conclude that breast-feeding protects children with a family history of atopy. It only found that breast-feeding was associated with lower rates of illness in normal children with a family history of atopy, both in the first and first three years of life."
Does escalation of the apical dose change treatment outcome in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques?,Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To show the results of treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy and to review and discuss the literature concerning the optimal apical dose prescription (100 vs. 160 Gy). Forty-eight patients with uveal melanomas (median height 3.85 mm + 1 mm sclera) were treated with ruthenium plaques. The median apical dose was 120 Gy, the median scleral dose 546 Gy. After 5.8 years of follow-up, the overall 5-year survival rate was 90%, the disease specific 5-year survival rate was 92% (3 patients alive with metastasis). Six percent received a second ruthenium application, 10% of the eyes had to be enucleated. Local control was achieved in 90% of the patients with conservative therapy alone. Central or paracentral tumors showed 50% of the pretherapeutic vision after 4 years, and 80% of the vision was preserved in those with peripheral tumors. The main side effects were mostly an uncomplicated retinopathy (30%); macular degeneration or scarring led to poor central vision in 30% of cases.

Question: Does escalation of the apical dose change treatment outcome in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques?

Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control?,Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Minority patients with cancer experience worse control of their pain than do their white counterparts. This disparity may, in part, reflect more miscommunication between minority patients and their physicians. Therefore, we examined whether patient coaching could reduce disparities in pain control in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Sixty-seven English-speaking adult cancer outpatients, including 15 minorities, with moderate pain over the prior 2 weeks were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 34) or control group (N = 33). Experimental patients received a 20-minute individualized education and coaching session to increase knowledge of pain self-management, to redress personal misconceptions about pain treatment, and to rehearse an individually scripted patient-physician dialog about pain control. The control group received standardized information on controlling pain. Data on average pain (0-10 scale) were collected at enrollment and 2-week follow-up. At enrollment, minority patients had significantly more pain than their white counterparts (6.0 vs 5.0, P = 0.05). At follow-up, minorities in the control group continued to have more pain (6.4 vs 4.7, P = 0.01), whereas in the experimental group, disparities were eliminated (4.0 vs 4.3, P = 0.71). The effect of the intervention on reducing disparities was significant (P = 0.04).

Question: Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control?

<thought> The context clearly states that minority patients experience worse pain control than white counterparts, and that patient coaching could potentially mitigate this disparity. The study results support this – the intervention significantly reduced disparities in pain control.

<answer> Yes, patient coaching could reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. The study found that the experimental group experienced a significant reduction in pain disparities compared to the control group."
Does prior benign prostate biopsy predict outcome for patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy?,A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: To determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer. A total of 1369 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. Patients with a prior benign biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% versus 64%; P<0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or greater; P<0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability (odds ratio 0.57, P<0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the control group.

Does patient position during liver surgery influence the risk of venous air embolism?,The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: It is generally believed that positioning of the patient in a head-down tilt (Trendelenberg position) decreases the likelihood of a venous air embolism during liver resection. The physiological effect of variation in horizontal attitude on central and hepatic venous pressure was measured in 10 patients during liver surgery. Hemodynamic indices were recorded with the operating table in the horizontal, 20 degrees head-up and 20 degrees head-down positions. There was no demonstrable pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions. The absolute pressures did, however, vary in a predictable way, being highest in the head-down and lowest during head-up tilt. However, on no occasion was a negative intraluminal pressure recorded.

Are tuberculosis patients adherent to prescribed treatments in China?,"Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Tuberculosis (TB) patients face numerous difficulties adhering to the long-term, rigorous TB treatment regimen. Findings on TB patients' treatment adherence vary across existing literature and official reports. The present study attempted to determine the actual treatment adherence of new TB patients and to identify factors leading to non-adherence. A prospective cohort of 481 newly confirmed TB patients from three counties in western China were enrolled during June to December 2012 and was followed until June 2013. Patients who missed at least one dose of drugs or one follow-up re-examination during the treatment course were deemed as non-adherent. Influencing factors were identified using a logistic regression model. A total of 173 (36.0 %) patients experienced non-adherence and the loss to follow-up cases reached 136 (28.2 %). Only 13.9 % of patients took drugs under direct observation, and 60.5 % of patients were supervised by phone calls. Factor analyses suggested that patients who were observed by family members (OR:5.54, 95 % CI:2.87-10.69) and paying monthly service expenses above 450 RMB (OR:2.08, 95 % CI:1.35-3.19) were more likely to be non-adherent, while supervision by home visit (OR:0.06, 95 % CI:0.01-0.28) and phone calls (OR:0.27, 95 % CI:0.17-0.44) were protective factors.

Ultrasound in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis; a useful addition to clinical staging?,"While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. From 1988 until 1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination. In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen examinations.

Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?,"There is no difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view studies. Although oblique views have long been considered standard practice by some, our data could not identify a diagnostic benefit that might outweigh the additional cost and radiation exposure.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were determined from radiology billing data. There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv). The charge for four-view studies was $145 more than that for two-view studies.

Question: Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?

<thought> The study’s findings suggest that oblique radiographs do NOT add significant value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis compared to two-view radiographs. While the sensitivity and specificity are similar, the inter-rater and intra-rater agreement are moderate. Furthermore, the radiation dose is a significant factor, with four-view studies costing more than two-view studies. The study concludes that the radiation effective dose is a concern. It’s important to note the study’s limitations regarding cost and the lack of a definitive conclusion regarding diagnostic value.

No, oblique views do not add significant value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis based on the current data. While the sensitivity and specificity are similar, the inter-rater and intra-rater agreement are moderate, and the radiation dose is a concern."
Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas?,"In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse. A large cross-sectional study was done in a prospective database of all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. All consecutive endoscopies over a period of 15 years, in which colorectal cancer was diagnosed were included. All patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was diagnosed were studied separately. Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 835 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent a previous endoscopy without a cancer diagnosis. These 25 patients were divided into three groups according to the time between the endoscopy in which the cancer was detected and the previous endoscopy. Five out of these 25 patients underwent regular surveillance. Only 11 patients had no argument for regular follow-up.

Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery?,"This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control intraoperative hypertension. In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with increments of drugs with controlled ventilation (N2O/O2=60/40%) until the start of surgery. A 5 Mhz transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted after intubation. Pulmonary artery catheter and TEE measurements were obtained after induction (to)(control value), at surgical incision (t1) if it was associated with an increase in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater than 140 mmHg (hypertension) and after control of hemodynamic parameters by administration of desflurane (return of systolic arterial pressure to within 20% of the control value) (t2) in a fresh gas flow of 31/ min. Sixteen patients developed hypertension at surgical incision. SAP was controlled by desflurane in all 16 patients. Afterload assessed by systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS) and left-ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) increased with incision until the hypertension returned to post-induction values with mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane. No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure.

Question: Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery?

<answer>Yes, the text indicates that desflurane likely alters left ventricular function during aortic surgery. Specifically, the study found increased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS), and left-ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) during surgical incision, indicating a potential decrease in LV function and a subsequent return to pre-induced values with a desflurane-induced decrease in blood pressure."
Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites?,Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age. Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations. At full term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites.

Can autologous platelet-rich plasma gel enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars?,"The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.",". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: This investigation assesses the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel on postoperative pain, swelling, and trismus as well as healing and bone regeneration potential on mandibular third molar extraction sockets. A prospective randomized comparative clinical study was undertaken over a 2-year period. Patients requiring surgical extraction of a single impacted third molar and who fell within the inclusion criteria and indicated willingness to return for recall visits were recruited. The predictor variable was application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar in the test group, whereas the control group had no PRP. The outcome variables were pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening, which were measured using a 10-point visual analog scale, tape, and millimeter caliper, respectively. Socket healing was assessed radiographically by allocating scores for lamina dura, overall density, and trabecular pattern. Quantitative data were presented as mean. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means between groups for continuous variables, whereas Fischer exact test was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was inferred at P<.05. Sixty patients aged 19 to 35 years (mean: 24.7 ± 3.6 years) were divided into both test and control groups of 30 patients each. The mean postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) was lower for the PRP group at all time points and this was statistically significant (P<.05). Although the figures for swelling and interincisal mouth opening were lower in the test group, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better among patients in the PRP group. This difference was also not statistically significant.

Question: Can autologous platelet-rich plasma gel enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars?
model
<thought> The study investigated the effect of PRP gel on postoperative pain, swelling, and healing in patients with impacted third molars. The results suggest PRP gel does improve healing outcomes – specifically, lower postoperative pain scores and better bone regeneration scores compared to the control group. However, the findings regarding swelling and interincisal mouth opening are not statistically significant. It’s a promising area for further research."
Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines?,Paediatric SF medicines were not more erosive than SC medicines in vitro; a more significant predictor of their erosive potential was dose form.,". Use <thought> and <answer> tags.

Context: The reduced use of sugars-containing (SC) liquid medicines has increased the use of other dose forms, potentially resulting in more widespread dental effects, including tooth wear. The aim of this study was to assess the erosive potential of 97 paediatric medicines in vitro. The study took the form of in vitro measurement of endogenous pH and titratable acidity (mmol). Endogenous pH was measured using a pH meter, followed by titration to pH 7.0 with 0.1-M NaOH. Overall, 55 (57%) formulations had an endogenous pH of<5.5. The mean (+/- SD) endogenous pH and titratable acidity for 41 SC formulations were 5.26 +/- 1.30 and 0.139 +/- 0.133 mmol, respectively; for 56 sugars-free (SF) formulations, these figures were 5.73 +/- 1.53 and 0.413 +/- 1.50 mmol (P>0.05). Compared with their SC bioequivalents, eight SF medicines showed no significant differences for pH or titratable acidity, while 15 higher-strength medicines showed lower pH (P = 0.035) and greater titratable acidity (P = 0.016) than their lower-strength equivalents. Chewable and dispersible tablets (P<0.001), gastrointestinal medicines (P = 0.002) and antibiotics (P = 0.007) were significant predictors of higher pH. In contrast, effervescent tablets (P<0.001), and nutrition and blood preparations (P = 0.021) were significant predictors of higher titratable acidity.

Question: Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines?
model
<thought> The text doesn’t directly state whether sugars-free medicines are more erosive. It only describes a trend – that reduced use of SC medicines is leading to increased use of other forms with potential for dental effects. However, it does suggest that SF formulations *do* show a lower pH and higher titratable acidity compared to SC formulations. 

<answer>
It’s difficult to definitively say whether sugars-free medicines are *more* erosive based solely on this information. The text suggests a trend, but doesn’t provide a direct comparison of erosive potential. However, the fact that SF formulations show lower pH and higher titratable acidity compared to SC formulations *does* indicate a potential for increased erosive potential."
